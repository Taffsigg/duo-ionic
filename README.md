# Duo - Travel Translator

Duo makes your traveling conversations much nicer, by providing a real time translation between any two languages, and a great UI for a 2 people conversation!
(I find Google Translate's interface awkward to use, and hard to find)

This is the source code for the [Duo - Travel Translator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-travel-translator/id1254876645?mt=8) app, released on iOS.
It is public to be used as a reference to the ionic native speech recognition, text to speech, and screen orientation plugins.

The app is no longer being developed, so there is no reason for the source not to be public.
